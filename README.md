# shiny-server-init-scripts
this repository holds *WORKING* init scripts for the shiny-server.
* I created it because I felt the need to do so because every init script I found (in the official Github shiny-server and elsewhere) was non-functional
* Currently shiny-server 1.4.2.0 is supported.

currently the scripts are under development and are at the moment *NONFUNCTIONAL*
